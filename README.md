# ME360: Computer Methods in Engineering
This repository provides course materials for the course ME360 at UH MƒÅnoa.

In this repository, you can find a collection of lecture notes, Jupyter Notebooks and [a sample course schedule](https://github.com/xiyudu/ME360/blob/main/course_schedule.md). If you are offering a similar course and want my sample homeworks, exams and filled in-class Jupyter Notebooks, please email me.

Special thanks for [Prof. Will Uspal](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~uspal/people.html) for providing me his course materials when I was developing my course.
