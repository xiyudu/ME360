# ME360: Computer Methods in Engineering
This repository provides course materials for the course ME360 at UH Mānoa.

The course materials provided in this repository are based on the textbook [Numerical Analysis](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/numerical-analysis/P200000006340) by Timothy Sauer. Chapters covered in the course are:
* Chapter 0: Fundamentals
  * 0.1 Evaluating a Polynomial
  * 0.2 Binary Numbers
  * 0.3 Floating Point Representation of Real Numbers
* Chapter 1: Solving Equations (root-finding)
  * 1.1 The Bisection Method
  * 1.2 Fixed-Point Iteration
  * 1.3 Limits
  * 1.4 Newton’s Method
  * 1.5 Root-Finding without Derivatives
* Chapter 2: Numerical Linear Algebra
  * 2.1 Gaussian Elimination
  * 2.2 The LU Factorization
  * 2.3 Sources of Error
  * 2.4 The PA = LU Factorization
* Chapter 5: Numerical Differentiation and Integration
  * 5.1 Numerical Differentiation
  * 5.2 Newton–Cotes Formulas for Numerical Integration
* Chapter 6, Ordinary Differential Equations
  * 6.1 Initial Value Problems
  * 6.2 Analysis of IVP Solvers
  * 6.3 Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations
  * 6.4 Runge–Kutta Methods and Applications

In this repository, you can find a collection of lecture notes, Jupyter Notebooks and [a sample course schedule](https://github.com/xiyudu/ME360/blob/main/course_schedule.md). If you are offering a similar course and want my sample homeworks, exams and filled in-class Jupyter Notebooks, please [email me](mailto:xiyudu@hawaii.edu).

Special thanks for [Prof. Will Uspal](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~uspal/people.html) for providing me his course materials when I was developing my course.
